Click on the badge above and it will take you there.  Don't be discouraged if it takes a few minutes to load, because it will be worth it!

- [Bits And Bytes](Bits%20and%20Bytes.ipynb)

    * Provides a function that will turn any integer number or string into a bunch of bits. 

- [Bits and Files](Bits%20in%20a%20File.ipynb)

    * Provides a function that will take a file and turn it into a number of equal sized blocks of bits or characters.
    
- [Encoding a File](Encode%20a%20message%20into%20DNA.ipynb)

    * An implementation of an encoder that uses a codebook to converts a textual message into DNA. This can be used to design strands.
